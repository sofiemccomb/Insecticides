a.	Perform Conley standard errors using best model on centroids of counties (200 km, no time lags) to examine spatial autocorrelation
i.	http://www.trfetzer.com/using-r-to-estimate-spatial-hac-errors-per-conley/
ii.	On favorite model, just for CP
b.	Remove counties with <1% of cropland and run best model, reporting in supplementary section on how many observations it removes; create map showing which counties are removed 
c.	Replaced percent crop (NLCD) with harvested crop (CoA) and re-run best model to identify if results change
d.	Run best model with fixed effects on county instead of ASD for supplementary figure, including table of xtsum output showing ASD better than county level in terms of remaining variation
e.	Retrive CoA data back to 1987 and create boxplots and run cross-sectional models on CoA data (large farm, crop covariates, harvested crop) from 1987-2017
f.	Make table with VIFs or maybe a correlation plot (library = corrplot I believe) for the landscape and patch metrics (Percent crop, edge density crops, mean patch size crops, large farms, crop diversity, landscape diversity).
