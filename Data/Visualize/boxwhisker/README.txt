Errorbar results from analyses. The folders have the visualizations from past runs of the scripts.

The current visualizations are in this folder.

CP is for counties pooled runs, and ERS for ERS code runs.
CP_compare is the basic visualization. _yrs has the error bars colored by whether there are 3 or 4 years of data.
_3yrs and _4yrs only have the models with either 3 or 4 years of data. 
_Forest and _ShrubGrass have natural lands exchanged out with only forest_crop or shrubgrass_crop edges.
ERS are the same, but for results grouped by ERS.
