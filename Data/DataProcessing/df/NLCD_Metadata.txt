Column names defined for NLCD.csv found under Data/DataProcessing/df, created by the NLCD.R script. 
	
All column names (except year and FIPS) are derived from the landscapemetrics (fragstats) computation calculated in the script.
Edge density is in meters per hectare, edge length is in meters, percentage of landscape is a percent (not divided by 100),
	mean patch area is in hectares, and landscape diversity is unitless (between 0-1).  
The shared columns are calculated from the binary reclassifications columns, and are calculated by taking the column of 
	shared edge length between the binary landcover types and dividing by the edge length of one of the binary landcover types.
	They are a metric for edge density for the binary reclassification calculations.
