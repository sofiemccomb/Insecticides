Column names defined for each of the 4 csvs found under Data/DataProcessing/NF, created by the NF.R script. 
	
All column names (except year and FIPS) are derived from the landscapemetrics (fragstats) computation calculated in the script.
Edge density is in meters per hectare, edge length is in meters, percentage of landscape is a percent (not divided by 100),
	mean patch area is in hectares, and landscape diversity is unitless (between 0-1).
