README: It must be emphasized that any pixel count or acreage data derived from these CDL county spreadsheets or through the CropScape website are not considered official NASS acreage estimates. There will be differences between CropScape and official NASS estimates when comparing acreage statistics at the state, district, and county levels. Statistics generated by CropScape and represented in these county spreadsheets are dependent upon pixel counting. Pixel counting is usually downward biased when compared to the official estimates. Counting pixels and multiplying by the area of each pixel will result in biased area estimates and should be considered raw numbers needing bias correction. Official crop acreage estimates at the state and county level are available at https://www.nass.usda.gov/.
Here are three references discussing the subject matter of pixel counting and estimation:

There are several grouped categories that have been tabulated, such as Soybeans_all which includes all soybean-related crop categories. Below are the category groupings:
    Corn_all         = Category_001 + Category_225 + Category_226 + Category_237 + Category_241;
    Cotton_all       = Category_002 + Category_232 + Category_238 + Category_239;
    Sorghum_all      = Category_004 + Category_234 + Category_235 + Category_236;
    Soybeans_all     = Category_005 + Category_026 + Category_239 + Category_240 + Category_241 + Category_254;
    Barley_all       = Category_021 + Category_233 + Category_235 + Category_237 + Category_254;
    Wheat_Durum_all  = Category_022 + Category_230 + Category_234;
    Wheat_Winter_all = Category_024 + Category_026 + Category_225 + Category_236 + Category_238;
    Oats_all         = Category_028 + Category_226 + Category_240;
    Canteloupe_all   = Category_209 + Category_231;
    Lettuce_all      = Category_227 + Category_230 + Category_231 + Category_232 + Category_233;
