This folder contains Rda files of the models results created in the Analysis.Rmd that can be loaded and directly called upon.

The models are created by the sourced cp and ERS model R scripts, called in the Analysis.Rmd,
	and are loaded in order to create the model statistic dataframes provided under the Analysis/df folder. 

The cp folder provides all the models for the counties pooled (cp) section of the Analysis.Rmd,
	while the ERS provides all the farm resource regions models. 
	The ERS models are available for each individual ERS code (numbered ERS subfolders).

The ERS zones are:  
1. Heartland
2. Northern Crescent 
3. Northern Great Plains
4. Prairie Gateway
5. Eastern Uplands 
6. Souther Seaboard
7. Fruitful Rim
8. Basin and Range 
9. Mississippi Portal 

Often the models are saved in multiple Rda files so that the files are not too large to be easily loaded onto Github.
Currently Rda files are subset by different model types (pooling, within), and whether or not crop covariates 
	are included in the model.
