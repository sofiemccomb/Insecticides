Column names defined for csvs detailed the coef, pval, se, and vif information for the regressions, created by the Analysis.Rmd.

The coef csv represents the model coefficients, the pval csv represents the model p-values per coefficient, 
the se csv represent the model standard error values per coefficient, and the vif csv represent the variable
inflation factor (multicollinearity between variables) for each model. 

The corr.Rda files give the correlation values between each of the variables used in the regression models.

For all four dataframes the first column gives the variable name being considered, while all other columns give either
the coefficient, p-value, standard error, or vif for each model. Therefore, the rest of the column names are the specific name
of the model being considered.

The counties pooled (cp) models have combined dataframes as all counties are considered, 
while the ERS models have each of these four dataframes available under separate ERS folders 
(given the ERS code number) as well as having all the information combined into an "all" dataframe,
that contains a column giving the ERS code.
