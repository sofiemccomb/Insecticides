The cp_vif.csv presents the variance inflation factor (vif) values for the counties pooled (cp) models run by the
	Analysis.Rmd script. 

The csv has the following columns: term, model, vif.
Term repersents the predictor variable name, model represents the specific county pooled model run (gives the model name),
	and vif provides the variance inflation factor value. 

The vif dataframe can be used to compare vif values. 
VIF values can be used to look at multicollinearity between variables (also can look at the cp_corr correlation matrices).

The vif function was only able to be run on pooled plm models (model=pooling) instead of the within fixed estimator models.
	However, since vif is about examining indepdenent variables, theoretically there is less need to control for effects.
	Simply using the values to examine collinearity between term values.

Generally, for the sake of our analysis, the values can be interpreted as:
	VIF of 1=no correlation among predictors, >4 investigate, >10 serious correction
