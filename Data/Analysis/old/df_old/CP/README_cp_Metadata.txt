The cp folder provides the statistical model results from the counties pooled (cp) section of the Analysis.Rmd.

A dataframe of the model statistics from all models is available in cp_df.csv,
	while cp_vif.csv provides the variance inflation factor values for each model.
	The cp_corr.Rda file provides the correlation values between each of the variables used in the regression models, 
	for the list of models run. The name of each list is the name of the model run.
