The ERS_all.csv provides the summary results from the ERS models, and is created by the Analysis.Rmd. 

The tidy function from the broom package was used to construct a dataframe summarizing the statistical findings of each model.
The columns include: term, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, model, and ERS. 
Term provides the character predictor variable name, estimate is the model coefficient, std. error is the error around
	the coefficient, statistic is the t-value, p.value is the p-value, model gives the
	the model name (represents what combination of variables and other details were run),
	and ERS gives the ERScode to represent the farm resource region being run.
