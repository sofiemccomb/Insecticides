The ERS folder provides the statistical model results from the ERS section of the Analysis.Rmd.

A summary of model results across all ERS farm resource regions are available in the ERS_all.csv and ERS_vif_all.csv,
	which are explained with their metadata txt files.

Furthermore, model results for each individual ERS resource region are available in the numbered folders, 
	which are numbered by their farm resource region.

The ERS zones are:  

1. Heartland
2. Northern Crescent 
3. Northern Great Plains
4. Prairie Gateway
5. Eastern Uplands 
6. Souther Seaboard
7. Fruitful Rim
8. Basin and Range 
9. Mississippi Portal

Furthermore, within each of the unique ERS code number folders there is an ERS_corr.Rda file that
	gives the correlation values between each of the variables used in the regression models, 
	for the list of models run. The name of each list is the name of the model run.
