The xtsum_df.Rda file provides the dataframe results of the estimation of variation within variables using 
	the fulldata dataset.

The xtsumR script was sourced, and is a derivitative of the XTSUM stata function that examines the 
	overall, within, and between variation found in a dataset.
The function was used to examined variation within variables (fips, year) for the main predictor variables being examined
	in the fulldata dataset.

Column names include: source, ovr.mean, ovr.sd, ovr.min, ovr.max, ovr.N, between.sd, between.min. between.max,
	Units, t.bar, within.sd, within.min, and within.max.

Source is the variable name, and which ID it was run for (FIPS or Year). 
Ovr. represents overall variation (across the dataframe).
Between represents between variation and within represents within variation. 

More information on how the values were calculated can be found in the xtsum script (R/Analysis/xtsumR.R).
